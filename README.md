# video-frame-interpolation

Recently there was a [stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75983462/is-it-possible-to-interpolate-a-quarter-of-the-video-with-optical-flow/75992992#75992992) on interpolating images between given 2 images.

I answered the question on a couple of self created images. 

In this repository, I demonstrate how we can use that approach to
1. Create a slow motion video from an input video
2. Create a high FPS video from an input video. 

The workings of this approach is explained in the linked stackoverflow question. 

Please consider staring the respository. Thanks
